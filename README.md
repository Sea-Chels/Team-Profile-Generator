# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application that requires interaction with the terminal. This is a Team-Profile-Generator. The npm package inquirer will ask a few questions to a theoretical manager, and then ask the manager if they want to add more employees to a team, you can add as many engineers or interns as you want, and when you are done, and decide not to add more employees, then an HTML page with the employee cards will be written, and you can load it into the web page and view your team. When you click on the emails on the page, your default email program will open up and open an email to the persons email. When you click on an Engineers github, it will open up on their github page.
